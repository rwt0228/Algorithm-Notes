### description  
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.  
  
The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.  
  
Note:  
  
Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.  
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.  
Example:  
  
```  
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [1,2]  
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.  
```  
  
### solution  
```  
class Solution {  
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {  
        int i = 0;  
        int j = numbers.length - 1;  
        while(i < j) {  
            int sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];  
            if(sum < target) {  
                i++;  
            } else if(sum > target) {  
                j--;  
            } else {  
                return new int[]{i + 1, j + 1};  
            }  
        }  
        return null;  
    }  
}  
```
